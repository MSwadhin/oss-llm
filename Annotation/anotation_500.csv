5111,"We have designed a generic ConversableAgent class for Agents that are capable of conversing with each other through the exchange of messages to jointly finish a task. An agent can communicate with other agents and perform actions. Different agents can differ in what actions they perform after receiving messages. Two representative subclasses are AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent.The AssistantAgent is designed to act as an AI assistant, using LLMs by default but not requiring human input or code execution. It could write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute when a message (typically a description of a task that needs to be solved) is received. Under the hood, the Python code is written by LLM (e.g., GPT-4). It can also receive the execution results and suggest corrections or bug fixes. Its behavior can be altered by passing a new system message. The LLM inference configuration can be configured via llm_config.The UserProxyAgent is conceptually a proxy agent for humans, soliciting human input as the agent's reply at each interaction turn by default and also having the capability to execute code and call functions. The UserProxyAgent triggers code execution automatically when it detects an executable code block in the received message and no human user input is provided. Code execution can be disabled by setting the code_execution_config parameter to False. LLM-based response is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting llm_config to a dict corresponding to the inference configuration. When llm_config is set as a dictionary, UserProxyAgent can generate replies using an LLM when code execution is not performed.The auto-reply capability of ConversableAgent allows for more autonomous multi-agent communication while retaining the possibility of human intervention.

 *
 * Covered Features:
 * - Renders the toggle switch without crashing
 * - Displays the correct icon state (on or off) based on the `enabled` prop
 * - Reflects the correct `aria-checked` accessibility attribute
 * - Calls the provided `setEnabled` callback with the correct value when toggled
 * - Correctly handles toggle behavior from both `true → false` and `false → true`
 *
 * The component uses `react-switch` for its toggle UI, which exposes the switch
 * element via the `role=""switch""` attribute, allowing for straightforward accessibility testing.

 * @function graphXlsx
 * @description
 * Fetches one or more XLSX files, caches their parsed workbooks, extracts data for multiple series,
 * and renders an ECharts chart. Multiple series can reference different `src` URLs, and each unique
 * file is loaded only once and then cached. After the chart is rendered, workbook objects are cleared
 * from memory.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Supports multiple data sources: each series can specify its own `src` to override the top-level `src`.
 * - Caches each loaded workbook keyed by `src`, so if multiple series share the same file, it isn't re-fetched.
 * - Automatically detects if the X-axis should be a category or value axis.
 * - Allows per-series chart types, line/point display configurations, and styling.
 * - Fetches titles and labels from cell references where needed.
 * - Adjusts axis bounds and ticks for clean numeric axes.
 *
