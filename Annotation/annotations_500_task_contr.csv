"We have designed a generic ConversableAgent class for Agents that are capable of conversing with each other through the exchange of messages to jointly finish a task. An agent can communicate with other agents and perform actions. Different agents can differ in what actions they perform after receiving messages. Two representative subclasses are AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent.The AssistantAgent is designed to act as an AI assistant, using LLMs by default but not requiring human input or code execution. It could write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute when a message (typically a description of a task that needs to be solved) is received. Under the hood, the Python code is written by LLM (e.g., GPT-4). It can also receive the execution results and suggest corrections or bug fixes. Its behavior can be altered by passing a new system message. The LLM inference configuration can be configured via llm_config.The UserProxyAgent is conceptually a proxy agent for humans, soliciting human input as the agent's reply at each interaction turn by default and also having the capability to execute code and call functions. The UserProxyAgent triggers code execution automatically when it detects an executable code block in the received message and no human user input is provided. Code execution can be disabled by setting the code_execution_config parameter to False. LLM-based response is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting llm_config to a dict corresponding to the inference configuration. When llm_config is set as a dictionary, UserProxyAgent can generate replies using an LLM when code execution is not performed.The auto-reply capability of ConversableAgent allows for more autonomous multi-agent communication while retaining the possibility of human intervention.

 * NotificationToggle.test.jsx

 * This test suite validates the behavior of the `NotificationToggle` component,

 * within the Rebel Remind Chrome extension.
 *
 * Covered Features:
 * - Renders the toggle switch without crashing
 * - Displays the correct icon state (on or off) based on the `enabled` prop
 * - Reflects the correct `aria-checked` accessibility attribute
 * - Calls the provided `setEnabled` callback with the correct value when toggled
 * - Correctly handles toggle behavior from both `true → false` and `false → true`
 *
 * The component uses `react-switch` for its toggle UI, which exposes the switch
 * element via the `role=""switch""` attribute, allowing for straightforward accessibility testing.

# Version History
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - 0.0 : Beta started.
# - 0.1 : Battles start and end correctly.
#	      Troop events are correctly triggered in battle. (mostly)
#		  Added an end window which appears when pressing ESC on the command window.
#		  That window allows you to escape and change options.
#		  Added the tags and parameters for one time move only and one time offense only.
#		  Fixed some errors in the demo.
# - 0.2 : The Item command is functional.
#		  Added custom move scopes and options.
#		  Downgraded the turn order visual for now to fix some bugs.
#		  Added a new option for turn order: ""fair repartition"".
#		  Status window is updated when a target is selected.
#		  There's now a help window. Status window is shifted if needed.
# - 0.3 : The mouse is supported.
#		  Prototype of the projectiles system.
#		  Prototype of the AI.
#		  Fixed a bug and improved the Turn Order Visual Version A.
#		  85% of the tile effects and marks system.
#		  Fixed a bug with the line of sight.
# - 0.4 : Now there is ony one unique tag.
#		  Support custom sprites. (Yay !)
#		  AI improved.
#		  Added AI patterns. They can be used in AI commands.
#		  Now each entity has his own sequence system. This allows simultaneous sequences.
#		  Added some sequence commands.
#		  Now a sequence is played for the following events:
#		  battle start, turn start, victory, death, damaged, healed, buffed, weakened.
# - 0.5 : Projectile system completed
#         Tile, Mark & Aura effects completed
#         Added knockback damage
#         Fixed and added some sequence commands
#         Fixed some bugs

 * @function graphXlsx
 * @description
 * Fetches one or more XLSX files, caches their parsed workbooks, extracts data for multiple series,
 * and renders an ECharts chart. Multiple series can reference different `src` URLs, and each unique
 * file is loaded only once and then cached. After the chart is rendered, workbook objects are cleared
 * from memory.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Supports multiple data sources: each series can specify its own `src` to override the top-level `src`.
 * - Caches each loaded workbook keyed by `src`, so if multiple series share the same file, it isn't re-fetched.
 * - Automatically detects if the X-axis should be a category or value axis.
 * - Allows per-series chart types, line/point display configurations, and styling.
 * - Fetches titles and labels from cell references where needed.
 * - Adjusts axis bounds and ticks for clean numeric axes.
 *
 * All of this code was created by ChatGPT, for more context on the creation of this code see the associated conversation thread:
