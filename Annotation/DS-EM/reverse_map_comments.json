Each feature map represents the result of dot products and/or applications of activation functions from different filters within the convolutional layers, highlighting various aspects and features of the input. Some maps might amplify edges, while others may focus on textures or more abstract patterns. In the feature maps, we can see how the pooling operations, for example, reduce dimensionality and compress the high dimensional images into a heatmap of size $8 \\times 8$, reducing the noise in the overall image and capturing more complex features that can shed light on certain properties of each image.

    "#         \"abstract\": \"Large language models are increasingly mediating, modifying, and even generating messages for users, but the receivers of these messages may not be aware of the involvement of AI. To examine this emerging direction of AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC), we investigate people's perceptions of AI written messages. We analyze how such perceptions change in accordance with the interpersonal emphasis of a given message. We conducted both large-scale surveys and in-depth interviews to investigate how a diverse set of factors influence people's perceived trust in AI-mediated writing of emails. We found that people's trust in email writers decreased when they were told that AI was involved in the writing process. Surprisingly trust increased when AI was used for writing more interpersonal emails (as opposed to more transactional ones). Our study provides insights regarding how people perceive AI-MC and has practical design implications on building AI-based products to aid human interlocutors in communication.\"": 1,

    "We have designed a generic ConversableAgent class for Agents that are capable of conversing with each other through the exchange of messages to jointly finish a task. An agent can communicate with other agents and perform actions. Different agents can differ in what actions they perform after receiving messages. Two representative subclasses are AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent.The AssistantAgent is designed to act as an AI assistant, using LLMs by default but not requiring human input or code execution. It could write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute when a message (typically a description of a task that needs to be solved) is received. Under the hood, the Python code is written by LLM (e.g., GPT-4). It can also receive the execution results and suggest corrections or bug fixes. Its behavior can be altered by passing a new system message. The LLM inference configuration can be configured via llm_config.The UserProxyAgent is conceptually a proxy agent for humans, soliciting human input as the agent's reply at each interaction turn by default and also having the capability to execute code and call functions. The UserProxyAgent triggers code execution automatically when it detects an executable code block in the received message and no human user input is provided. Code execution can be disabled by setting the code_execution_config parameter to False. LLM-based response is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting llm_config to a dict corresponding to the inference configuration. When llm_config is set as a dictionary, UserProxyAgent can generate replies using an LLM when code execution is not performed.The auto-reply capability of ConversableAgent allows for more autonomous multi-agent communication while retaining the possibility of human intervention.\n#": 1,

Please consider the following factors: \\n Language: AI-generated text often uses larger complex words while having a simpler meaning. \\n Structure: AI has smooth flow in text, overly polished, Predictable pattern of explanation and evidence. Humans tend to vary sentence structure more, and use more complex structures.\\n Analysis: Accurate but surface-level analysis. \\n Tone and Vocab: AI generated texts have an overly formal, stiff, impersonal style. Be careful not to flag formal but human text as AI-generated!\\n Ideas: AI generated models tend to have bland ideas or repeat them throughout the text.\\n Perplexity: Determine how consistent the provided text is with the output of an AI language model. A high perplexity increases the likelihood of the text being AI-generated.\\n Burstiness: Determine how consistent the perplexity of the text is. While human text may write one or two sentences that are similar to AI output, they will generally have output that resembles human output. Higher consistency means a lower burstiness - and means the text is more likely to be AI-generated.\\n Please generate your thought process as you determine whether the provided text is AI-generated or human.

In fact, 81% of customers want a human to be in the loop, reviewing and validating generative AI outputs. A mere 37% of customers trust AI's outputs to be as accurate as those of an employee. The research found that the trust gap widens as AI goes mainstream. Brands are turning to generative AI to boost efficiency while improving customer engagement. Customers -- wary of the technology risks -- demand a thoughtful approach built on trust. Eighty percent of customers say it's important for humans to validate AI's outputs. Also: Two breakthroughs made 2023 tech's most innovative year in over a decade Demystifying AI could significantly reduce the fear surrounding it. If we can move AI from an opaque black box to a transparent glass cube, we can recalibrate how we adopt the technology. A strong argument can be made that every AI foundational model must have a FICO score . The latest State of IT 2023 Report by Salesforce, a survey of 4,300 IT decision-makers and leaders, found that 9 out of 10 CIOs believe generative AI has gone mainstream. The report found that AI and automation underpin efficiency and innovation. Process automation is on the rise as businesses tighten their belts and seek efficiency boosts, while advances in AI prompt IT to determine how -- not if -- to responsibly propel their organizations forward. Eighty-six percent of IT leaders believe generative AI will have a prominent role in their organizations in the near future. McKinsey's latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases analyzed by McKinsey -- by comparison, the United Kingdom's entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. https://t.co/CtEHUZXe1o pic.twitter.com/YLTMhPPN25 \\u2014 Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) August 9, 2023 According to McKinsey , 50% of organizations used AI in 2022. IDC is forecasting global AI spending to increase a staggering 26.9% in 2023 alone. A recent survey of customer service professionals found adoption of AI had risen by 88% between 2020 and 2022. McKinsey's latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases. Generative AI will revolutionize the way we work. Also: AI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged AI is the electricity of the 21st century. Ignore it and your business will be left in the dark. After all, we already know many ways that generative AI will shape how we work . Research on generative AI's impact on the future of work reveals that AI has the potential to automate 40% of the average workday. Productivity gains from generative AI in marketing sees marketers saving one month a year. https://t.co/IAFuwJORWa \\u2014 Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) August 10, 2023 A survey suggests AI has the potential to automate 40% of the average work day, according to research firm Valoir . The widespread use of generative artificial intelligence has raised public awareness of its ability to increase productivity and efficiency, as well as its risks. AI and automation propel efficiency and innovation. Salesforce So, what are the largest and most influential technology analyst firms saying about the impact of generative AI on the future of work and the enterprise? According to Gartner, generative AI will make an increasingly strong impact on enterprises over the next five years. Gartner predicts that: By 2024, 40% of enterprise applications will have embedded conversational AI, up from less than 5% in 2020. By 2025, 30% of enterprises will have implemented an AI-augmented development and testing strategy, up from 5% in 2021. By 2026, generative design AI will automate 60% of the design effort for new websites and mobile apps. By 2026, over 100 million humans will engage robocolleagues to contribute to their work. By 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop, which is not happening at all today. More than 55% of all data analysis by deep neural networks will occur at the point of capture in an edge system by 2025, up from less than 10% in 2021. The primary focus of generative AI initiatives. Gartner Generative AI is positioned on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2023 . Here are Gartner's top 10 strategic predictions : By 2027, the productivity value of AI will be recognized as a primary economic indicator of national power. By 2027, GenAI tools will be used to explain legacy business applications and create appropriate replacements, reducing modernization costs by 70%. By 2028, enterprise spending on battling malinformation will surpass $30 billion, cannibalizing 10% of marketing and cybersecurity budgets to combat a multifront threat. By 2027, 45% of chief information security officers (CISOs) will expand their remit beyond cybersecurity, due to increasing regulatory pressure and attack surface expansion. By 2028, the rate of unionization among knowledge workers will increase by 1,000%, motivated by the adoption of GenAI. In 2026, 30% of workers will leverage digital charisma filters to achieve previously unattainable advances in their careers. By 2027, 25% of Fortune 500 companies will actively recruit neurodivergent talent across conditions like autism, ADHD, and dyslexia to improve business performance. By 2028, there will be more smart robots than frontline workers in manufacturing, retail, and logistics due to labor shortages. By 2026, 50% of G20 members will experience monthly electricity rationing, turning energy-aware operations into either a competitive advantage or a major failure risk. By 2026, generative AI will significantly alter 70% of the design and development effort for new web applications and mobile apps. Generative AI is positioned on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Gartner, Inc. Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2023 . Gartner IDC believes that the tech industry is at a seminal moment. Never have we seen a technology emerge with this much executive support, clearly defined business outcomes, and rapid adoption. Also: These 5 major tech advances of 2023 were the biggest game-changers IDC has identified three broad types of generative AI use cases that need to be assessed that are industry specific, business function, and productivity-related. Generative AI: The path to impact. IDC IDC notes that the landscape of business may be seeing a seismic shift with the rise of generative AI. IDC advises business leaders to start with the following solid foundation: Responsible AI policy: A well-defined AI policy that outlines principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, and data protection is paramount. AI strategy and roadmap and the role of the proof of concept: The AI strategy should include the rules or guidelines for generative AI proofs of concept (POCs), and it should incorporate the results of the POCs to recursively improve the strategy. Intelligent architecture: Data privacy, security, and intellectual property protection must also be embedded within this platform architecture. Reskilling and training: Most organizations do not have mature skill sets (prompt engineering, data science, data analysis, AI ethics, modeling) required to take full advantage of generative AI. IDC also notes that data serves as the foundation for generative AI. When IDC surveyed clients about their data, troubling results were revealed. 82% of organizations report siloed data ( Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey ). 41% cite that data is changing faster than they can keep up with ( Global Data Valuation Survey ). 24% do not trust their data ( Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey ). 29% have issues with data quality ( Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey ). By 2025, according to IDC, organizations will allocate over 40% of their core IT spend to AI-related initiatives, leading to a double-digit increase in the rate of product and process innovations. AI will radically reshape IT , according to IDC. Code generation, enterprise content management, marketing, and customer experience applications are some of the key areas for generative AI use cases in the enterprise , per IDC. IDC forecasts enterprise spending on GenAI services, software and infrastructure will grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $143 billion in 2027. Spending on generative AI over the four-year period to 2027 is expected to reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 73.3%. 2023 STATE OF IT REPORT 20 key IT statistics and trends found that every CIO should know: 1. 84% of IT leaders say their departments need to better address changing customer expectations. 2. 82% of IT leaders say their departments need to better demonstrate business\\u2026 \\u2014 Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) September 5, 2023 Forrester research points to the next generation of modern software development, where generative AI TuringBots speed and improve software development. Forrester defines TuringBots as: AI-powered software that augments application development and infrastructure and operations teams' automation and semiautonomous capabilities to plan, analyze, design, code, test, deliver, and deploy while providing assistive intelligence on code, development processes, and applications. Also: Today's AI boom will amplify social problems if we don't act now, says AI ethicist Forrester predicts that TuringBots will write 10% of worldwide code and tests. Here are additional Forrester generative AI predictions for the enterprise: One in four tech execs will report to their board on AI governance. Forrester's data shows that 46% of data and analytics business and technology decision-makers seek out partners to implement AI that's critical to the business. Ten percent of Fortune 500 enterprises will generate content with AI tools. Generative AI TuringBots improve software development. Forrester Forrester predicts that Generative AI will be the fulcrum that businesses rely on to enhance, empower, and engage employees and customers -- with or without you. Forrester's predictions on AI include: Generative AI will seep into consumers' lives. Sixty percent of skeptics will use (and love) generative AI -- knowing it or not. AI will spur the age of creativity. Enterprise AI initiatives will boost productivity and creative problem-solving by 50%. Current AI projects already cite improvements of up to 40% in software development tasks. GenAI will augment customer service agents' capabilities. Customer Experience (CX) will improve for the first time in three years. Improvements will be most pronounced in Europe and APAC. In North America, the US will improve, while Canada will continue to struggle. Marketers will become privacy champions . CMOs at five large consumer brands will fund dedicated privacy resources. Yet, only 17% of privacy decision-makers say that their organization's privacy team has marketing competencies or skills. To bust this bottleneck, five large B2C brands will earmark a portion of their marketing budget specifically to fund additional headcount to the privacy team and/or upskill existing privacy colleagues. Generative AI dominated the top 10 emerging technologies of 2023 report by Forrester. The research notes that generative AI will strain most firms' ability to take risks and make good bets on emerging technology. Forrester research on the impact of generative AI on marketing notes the benefits of scale and precision to marketing. The research identifies the following benefits: 1. enhancing human intuition with intelligence; 2. amplifying creators' work; and 3. adding scale and speed to creative quality. Top 10 Emerging Technologies 2023. Forrester Constellation Research believes generative AI will supercharge the future of work. The research notes that many work tasks will benefit from between a 1.3x to 5x gain in speed alone. Constellation research advice on the adoption of generative AI in the digital workplace is to have the following: Clear AI guidelines and policies Education and training AI governance structures Oversight and monitoring Collaboration and feedback Create clear ethical guidelines Conduct ethical impact assessments Monitor for AI bias Provide transparency Ensure compliance with regulations Constellation also provides a list of the leading generative AI enterprise grade solutions. Constellation also breaks down the impact of generative AI by industry . For the education industry, Constellation notes that Generative AI, which appears to be initially loved by students and loathed by educators, is coming to education as its embedded in courseware as well as learning-management systems. The overall forecasts are optimistic, but there are cautionary notes about guardrails for AI . Generative AI and the future of work. Constellation Research Ventana Research highlights how generative AI helps sales and marketing in practical ways. Ventana notes: \\\"For marketing, one way this will happen is by improving the efficiency of marketing copy and potentially enabling personalization at scale. For field sales, the suggestions are that generative AI will improve both the ability of sales to craft emails for outreach and responses and to enhance presentations. Other use cases include using generative AI to summarize calls automatically and post them to the associated opportunity record, improving both accuracy and timeliness. This will have positive effects on sales productivity, but on its own will represent less a revolution than an evolution.\\\" By 2025, more than one-quarter of sales organizations will utilize generative AI to auto-summarize meetings, personalize outreach at scale, and generate tailored sales enablement to improve sales productivity and allow more time for direct sales engagement to improve win rates, according to Ventana . The use of AI to advance automation and enhance efficiency is another example of intelligent automation as a powerful tool for CIOs.

    "#     \"content\": \"According to research completed by a BGSU doctoral candidate, humans can correctly identify human-made art about half the time, similar to the rate of a coin toss. Above, only one of the two post-impressionist paintings\\u2014Paul Cezanne's Banks of the Seine at Medan\\u2014is manmade. The Paris landscape was made by AI. Credit: Bowling Green State University New research from Bowling Green State University finds that generative artificial intelligence\\u2014or AI\\u2014can blur the lines when it comes to identifying the source of images, but discovered humans still maintain a subsurface preference for genuine human art. Andrew Samo, a doctoral candidate studying industrial and organizational psychology at BGSU, published research along with Distinguished Research Professor Dr. Scott Highhouse on AI versus human artwork in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts , which found that people generally can't tell the difference between AI and human art, but they prefer the latter\\u2014even if they can't explain why. \\\"Art was thought to be uniquely human because it gives off a feeling or communicates some idea about the human experience that machines don't have,\\\" Samo said. \\\"In some ways, it's to be expected people felt more strongly about human-made art. \\\"But at the same time, it was surprising: How can people feel so differently about one, but not be able to cognitively explain why?\\\" Building from the past Prior research had found that humans tend to show bias against AI artwork, but as new, generative AI models continued to improve, Samo and Highhouse wondered if people would be able to tell the difference between AI art and human art without prodding. To answer their question\\u2014and eliminate bias\\u2014participants were not told that some of the art they would view would be made by AI. Instead, they were only told they would be viewing a series of pictures and rating them on 30\\u201350 aesthetic judgment factors, a reliable, psychometrics-rooted method of quantifying artistic emotions and experiences. \\\"Previous research demonstrated that people are biased against art if they know it was made by AI, and they'll say they don't like it as much,\\\" Samo said. \\\"But no one had really looked at this new AI art without any kind of deception. I thought, \\\"If we just show people these images, would they even know which is made by humans and which is made by AI? And if they do know which one is which, how do we know what features distinguish them?\\\" What they found showed the capability of generative AI: Participants correctly identified the source of the artwork only slightly more than half the time, and even so, were not confident that their guesses were correct. \\\"It's really a coin flip\\u2014when you show them the pictures, there's about a 50%\\u201360% chance they'll get it right,\\\" Samo said. \\\"Generally, people don't know which is which, and when we asked how confident they were, they were typically saying they were only 50% confident. An unexplainable feeling The struggle in differentiating between originators of artwork came with another interesting finding: People prefer human artwork, even if they aren't totally sure why. After reviewing data, Samo and Highhouse found there were clear differences in how people felt about human artwork versus AI artwork. Even though participants were not confident in their identification of the source, they consistently felt more positively about human-generated art. \\\"They typically didn't know the difference and admitted they couldn't tell the difference once you asked them, but the next layer of that is people reliably said they liked the human images more without even knowing whether it was AI or not,\\\" Samo said. \\\"We found people have more positive emotions when looking at the human paintings, which makes sense.\\\" Out of all the aesthetic judgment factors, four accounted for the majority of the variance. Human-made art scored higher in self-reflection , attraction, nostalgia and amusement, a sign that people felt more connected to human art. But when asked why participants felt that way, they couldn't explain it. One interpretation is that their snap judgments connected with human art, but their analytical processing couldn't quite articulate why they felt that way. A theory the researchers discuss in the paper is the possibility that the brain picks up on tiny differences in art created by AI. \\\"One possible explanation could be the uncanny valley effect\\u2014something that is trying to look human\\u2014but there are these micro-perceptions that are slightly off,\\\" Samo said. \\\"Everything looks good holistically, but there are these small details in the visuals or creative narratives that your subconscious is picking up on the rest of you isn't.\\\" The next wave While AI was once believed to be able to replicate only certain tasks like those on an assembly line , for instance, generative models have shown the capacity to do much, much more. Samo and Highhouse's research is a glimpse into the possibilities of generative AI. \\\"For the longest time, AI was thought to be able to automate line work, data management, or anything else that's very repetitive, routine, or non-original,\\\" Samo said. \\\"But with generative AI models, they're able to not only do those repetitive tasks but come up with art, music, poetry, prose, text that is almost indistinguishable from humans. And this raises exciting possibilities for applications of generative AI.\\\" In the short time since Samo and Highhouse collected data, generative AI models have continued to improve and become more widely available. As AI evolves, Samo said it's important to continue to understand the psychological effects and human impacts of AI as models become more powerful and used in everyday life. \\\"Some of these new models can generate images that are really high quality and high fidelity toward the actual world, so it'd be interesting to run this study again,\\\" Samo said. \\\"If you redid this, I'm not sure if people would be able to tell the differences at all.\\\" More information: Andrew Samo et al, Artificial intelligence and art: Identifying the aesthetic judgment factors that distinguish human- and machine-generated artwork, Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts (2023).

You can check this by going to the Firebase Console, navigating to the Realtime Database section, and looking at the typing node while you're typing something into the input field.\n    - Open your Firebase project in the Firebase Console. You can do this by navigating to the Firebase Console and clicking on your project.\n\n    - In the left-hand menu, you should see a section labeled \"Develop\". Under this section, you'll find both \"Cloud Firestore\" and \"Realtime Database\".\n\n    - Click on \"Realtime Database\". This will take you to the Realtime Database interface.\n\n    - In the Realtime Database interface, you should see a tree-like structure representing your database.

The next step, read the following:\n  So, I started typing this: \"I see that you're sending setDatabaseValue(typingRef, isTyping) up on each keystroke.\" Then Copilot suggested this:\n  \"This is not what you want. You want to send it only when the user starts typing and when the user stops typing. You can do this by using a timer. When the user starts typing, you start a timer. When the user stops typing, you clear the timer. If the timer expires, then you send the typing status to the database. This is how you can avoid sending the typing status on each keystroke.\"\n  DM: this is a good point. but it is not really clear. I would think of it this way:\n  * on the first keystroke, you send typing=true to the databse, then you set a timer to expire in 3 seconds. when it it expires, you send typing=false to the database.\n  * on the next keystroke, you clear the timer, then you send typing=true to the database, then you set a timer to expire in 3 seconds. when it it expires, it sends typing=false to the database.\n  * this reliably records\n  * you can also \"throttle\" (see \"throttle vs debounce\") the keystrokes to 3 seconds. This way you don't send a keystroke every time the user types a letter, but only every 3 seconds. This is a good idea because it reduces the number of writes to the database, which is good for performance and cost.\n\n  */": 1,

    "/*\nIn order to fix the \"login: usually when I enter email, when I put cursor into the input field and type first letter, Chrome will show previous emails I've used, but it doesn't work in the login screen. I'm curious why that is the case, as all login forms allow that default Chrome functionality to happen.\" task from the official-ux-review file, I did the following: \n  1. asked AI to fix the suggested task above, the answer was: \n    - To enable autofill for the email input field, you need to set the \"autocomplete\" attribute to \"email\" in your Login component\n\n  2. I added the \"autocomplete\" attribute to the email input field with the value of \"email\" and to the password input field with the value of \"off\" (to avoid chrome autofill for security reasons)\n  3. to test it, i found that i need to add a logout feature to the app because if i delete the account from the firebase console, i'll have to signup again and the  autofill will not display the email address.\n  4. i created a signOut function in the firebase.js file.\n  5. i created a handleSignOut function in the User component whee i imported the signOut function from the firebase.js file.\n  I couldn't guess where to use the signOut function between User and UserProfile components, if i use it in the User it will be not possible because i wanted users to logout when they access their profile page, so i used it in the UserProfile component.\n  6. i added a logout button in the UserProfile component and i passed the handleSignOut function to it.\n  7. when i was clicking to the signout button, it was directing me to the chat page instead of to the login page.\n  8. AI suggested to use the useHistory hook to redirect the user to the login page after signout. when i added the useHistory hook, i got an error that useHistory is not defined. i searched for the solution and i found that i need to wrap the component with the React Router component by first installing it and then importing it and wrapping the component with it.\n  9. after installing the react-router-dom package, i realized that the app is configured with NextJS, so it's no use using react-router-dom package, so i searched for the solution and i found that i need to use the useRouter hook instead of the useHistory hook.\n  10. the suggested code was:\n    import { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n    const router = useRouter()\n    const handleSignOut = async () => {\n      try {\n        await signOut()\n        setProfileVisible(false)\n        router.push('/login') // Redirect to login page\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error signing out', error)\n      }\n    }\n\n  11. when i click i got the error that the ./login page is not found. what is should was to use the create a new login.js file inside pages directory to solve the problem, when i tested it, i found that the props passed to the Login component are not defined, which is the handleLogin, error, toggleAuthenticationMode, now instead of passing them as props, i should use them directly in the Login component, and i would so with the Signup component as well.\n  12. that logic was not working, AI suggested to use AuthContext to pass the props to the Login component by defining the AuthContext in the root component and then using the useContext hook in the Login component to get the props. this approach seemed to be better than the first one, but the issue was the User component could not access the Login and Signup components.\n  13. the final idea was to import the User component in the UserProfile component and create a new state by creating a condition that if the signout button is clicked, the state will be set to true and the User component will be rendered, and if the state is false, the UserProfile component will be rendered.\n  14. i finally fixed the issue by setting up a new Firebase auth state listener in the RealTimeChat component that check If a user is authenticated, it will set isAuthenticated to true, otherwise it will set it to false inside the useEffect hook, i also imported the auth from the firebase.js file and passed it to the useEffect hook.\n\n  DM: thanks for the detailed explanation. it helps me kow what you did, how you're thinking and is great practice in tech communication for you. \n  (done)DM: todoMM: put a logout button on the main app page, not just the profile page.\n  (done)DM: make the signup fields autofill\n\n  DM: it happens sometimes when you do a ton of work but later find out there was a much easier way to do it.

Create an async function: The loadUsers function is an asynchronous function because it needs to wait for the users to be fetched from the Firestore database.\n\n  2. Set loading state: At the start of the function, the loading state is set to true to indicate that the users are being fetched.\n\n  3. Fetch users: The getDocs function from 'firebase/firestore' is used to fetch all documents from the 'users' collection in the Firestore database. The returned snapshot is stored in the snapshot variable.\n\n  4. Map over documents: The documents in the snapshot are mapped over to create an array of user objects. Each document is converted to an object with the .data() method, and the document ID (which is the user's uid) is added to this object.\n\n  5. Update state: The setAllUsers function is used to update the allUsers state with the fetched users. The connectedUsers state is updated with the users who are active. The loading state is set to false to indicate that the users have been fetched.\n\n  6. Handle errors: If an error occurs while fetching the users, the catch block is executed. The loading state is set to false, the error state is updated with the error message, and the error message is logged to the console.\n\n  7. Call the function: The loadUsers function is called inside a useEffect hook so that it runs when the component mounts.\n\nuseUsersUpdates hook:\n\n  1. Create a useEffect hook: The useUsersUpdates hook is a useEffect hook that runs when the allUsers and setConnectedUsers variables change.\n\n  2. Subscribe to changes: The onSnapshot function from 'firebase/firestore' is used to subscribe to changes in the 'users' collection in the Firestore database. The returned function is stored in the unsubscribe variable.\n\n  3. Handle changes: When a change is detected, the snapshot.docChanges().forEach method is used to iterate over each change in the collection snapshot. For each change, a user object is created from the document data, and the connectedUsers state is updated with the updated user data.\n\n  4. Cleanup: The unsubscribe function is called in the cleanup function to prevent memory leaks and potential errors.\n\n  5. Call the hook: The useUsersUpdates hook is called with the setConnectedUsers, allUsers, and setError variables as arguments.\n\nI encountered errors like: \nto fix them i :\n\n  1. Identified the problem: The initial problem was that i was getting a TypeError when trying to use the get method on usersCollection. This was because in Firebase v9 and above, the get method is not directly used on the collection reference.\n\n  2. Updated the Firebase import and usage: In Firebase v9 and above, i should use the getDocs function from 'firebase/firestore' to get all documents from a collection. So, the line const snapshot = await usersCollection.get() was replaced with const snapshot = await getDocs(usersCollection).\n\n  3. Imported the necessary Firebase functions: The getDocs function was imported from 'firebase/firestore' at the top of the file.\n\n  4. Updated the loadUsers function: The loadUsers function was updated to use getDocs instead of get. This function fetches all documents from the 'users' collection, maps over the documents to create an array of user objects, and updates the state with these users.\n\n  5. Updated the useUsersUpdates hook: The useUsersUpdates hook was updated to use the onSnapshot function from 'firebase/firestore' instead of usersCollection.onSnapshot. The onSnapshot function is used to listen for real-time updates to the 'users' collection. When a change is detected, the hook updates the connectedUsers state with the updated user data.\n\n  6. Handled errors: In both the loadUsers function and the useUsersUpdates hook, errors are caught and handled. In loadUsers, if an error occurs while fetching the users, the error message is logged to the console and the error state is updated with the error message. In useUsersUpdates, the unsubscribe function returned by onSnapshot is called in the cleanup function to prevent memory leaks and potential errors.\n*/": 1,

    "/*\nMM: DM: i faced blockers when i click a signup button of not loading and crashing the application: firebase error: next-dev.js:25 Error adding document:  FirebaseError: Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field user in document messages/tuCI3kKosIYNkT8UtssY). i tried all the solutions suggested by AI by adding console.log to the handleSignup function elements, but the errors still persist.\nafter debugging i found that displayName is undefined. i commented the code and reverted the first ones, you can uncomment and have look at the errors. DM: I can't know which of the many commented out lines in this file to uncomment in order to see what you we're doing. Either leave specific instructions about what lines to uncomment, or leave the code in the exact state it was in when you got stuck, so I can see what you tried and what the errors are. (I know I've told you in the past not to leave the code in an error state, but if you note it specifically in a comment that you're leaving it broken so that I can help debug, its ok. MM: i think i am doing my best to follow all the instructions you are providing even though i am missing out some, in this firebase config case, i tried all the necessaries approaches by googling and asking AI suggestions as well, but i found it's very hard on my level to debug it. in the previous config of keeping secrets keys in env file, i attempted all the solutions but i couldn't get it right. i described the steps that i undertaken, however on your reviews i was expecting you to give me the right hints to solve the problem, but you have not yet. for implementing real-time messaging, i tried all the possible solutions as i mentioned above, but i was having errors, so i decided to keep the code in comments so that you would check them and give me hints to follow. i mentioned that in comments, the code made crash the app, and slow down the computer. how could i keep the app crash?, because i knew you would tell me to not leave the code in the error state.) \nDM: RE secrets in the env file: see my new note in the firebase.js file\nDM: RE real-time messaging in your comment above: the point of my last message in the same line is I need specific instructions about what to uncomment. There is a ton of code commented in this file. Either give me exact instructions to reproduce your issue, or push the code in the broken state (which we usually avoid, but if you call it out for the purpose of me helping debug it is ok. There is nothing wrong with what you are coding and debugging, it is just how you are communicating to me that was my difficulty yesterday. So, before you you commit, look at the diff of your today's changes, and  imagine me reading the diff and your comments, and ask yourself, will I know what to do to reproduce the issue? Make it \"easy\" for me to help you. Clear communication takes work and practice, but it is worth practicing as you'll need in on the job.(MM: i understand. i will try to be more specific in my comments. i will try to push the code in the broken state.)\n\nDM: todays bugs looks like it was difficult to figure out. One possible approach: the reason I had you do the codesandbox exercise, is you can try to implement just the part that is breaking (the login/signup?) in a new clean NextJS project, and once you have it working there, it will be easier to see what is different in your chat project and get clues as to why it is not working. It is your decision. If not, maybe if you leave the code in the broken state, I can see what you tried and get clues as to what is wrong. Definitely look closer at the error object and try to determine from all the details there what went wrong, including google the error messages you get. \n\n*/": 1,

The pivot helps partition the array.\n\nPartitioning: We partition the array into two parts:\n\nLeft: Contains elements less than the pivot.\nRight: Contains elements greater than or equal to the pivot.\nRecursion: The quickSort function is called recursively on both the left and right arrays, which are then concatenated with the pivot to form the sorted array.\n\nConcatenation: The final sorted array is constructed by combining the sorted left array, the pivot, and the sorted right array.\n=============================================================================================================\nComplexity\nTime Complexity:\n\nAverage Case: O(n log n)\nWorst Case: O(n\u00b2) - occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot\nSpace Complexity: O(log n) - due to recursive function calls\n=============================================================================================================\nOptimizations\nTo improve the performance of Quick Sort, consider the following optimizations:\n\n1) Randomized Pivot: Randomly selecting the pivot element can help reduce the likelihood of encountering the worst-case scenario.\n\n2) Three-Way Partitioning: Handling duplicates more efficiently by using three partitions (less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot).\n\n3) Switching to Insertion Sort for Small Arrays: For very small subarrays, using Insertion Sort may be faster than recursive Quick Sort due to lower overhead.\n=============================================================================================================\nUsage\nYou can use this code to sort any array of numbers. Simply pass your unsorted array to the quickSort function, and it will return a new sorted array.\n\njavascript\nCopy code\nconst unsortedArray = [9, -3, 5, 2, 6, 8, -6, 1, 3];\nconst sortedArray = quickSort(unsortedArray);\nconsole.log(sortedArray); // Output: [-6, -3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]\n=============================================================================================================\n*/": 1,

Also recieved help from a course tutor. \r\n\r\nA course tutor and chatGPT helped me get my assignment to show on a full screen for the website.\r\n\r\nOld Asgn3B Notes: I was able to get my 3 different types of light sources in my implementation (ambient, directional, rectArea) but I could't figure out how to seperate the controls on my html page correctly. I was able to get the 3 light sources on my implementation with just the three.js.org guides, but I tried asking chatgpt for help on fixing the lighting controls on the top right corner (not part of the assignment) after meeting with various course tutors on how to fix it but they didn't know. The GUI implementations (for lighting controls) are a mix of three.js.org code and chat gpt suggested code that didn't really work every even after hours of trying to debug. I ended up not being able to fix the lighting controls, but I did all of the required points for 5B.\r\n*/": 1,

The above text was how it answered\n * when I asked it how to give credit.  I used ChatGPT because I keep forgetting\n * how <canvas> works and I was lazy (a good trait, says Larry Wall).  The\n * code is the result of the following prompt, with later edits to generalize\n * the results slightly. Excluding variable naming changes, this is almost\n * exactly as-provided.\n *\n ** 1:\n * I'm building a vintage computer emulator in Javascript.  I want to provide a\n * visualization of memory in the running emulator.  The memory is interfaced\n * with through a DataView to a 65536-byte ArrayBuffer that is logically divided\n * into 32768 16-bit words.  I want to see each of those 16-bit words transformed\n * into a color using RGB565.\n ** 2:\n * Please write a Javascript function that takes a DataView as an argument,\n * creates a <canvas> element, draws the DataView into the <canvas> as described\n * above, then returns the <canvas>.\n ** 3:\n * I'd like each word in the DataView to be represented by a 2x2 box on the\n * canvas instead of a single pixel.  Please adjust the code to make the canvas\n * large enough to hold all 32768 words at that drawing size.\n ** 4:\n * I'd like each row in the canvas to represent 64 16-bit words.  This means that\n * we'll end up with 512 rows of 64 columns.  Please adjust the code to take the\n * DataView and render it into a <canvas> so that each 16-bit word takes up a 2x2\n * spot on the canvas.\n ** 5:\n * Let's define some constants.  Use these constants to create a new version of\n * the DataView visualization:\n *\n * const WORDS_IN_DATAVIEW = 32768; // (pretend this exists - ed)\n * const WORDS_PER_VISUAL_ROW = 64;\n * const TOTAL_VISUAL_ROWS = 512; // 32768 words total, divided into rows\n *                                // of 64 words each = 512 rows\n * Given these constants and the desire to render each word as a square of 2x2\n * pixels, calculate the correct size of the <canvas>, and then process all of\n * the words in the DataView onto the canvas using RGB565.\n **\n *\n * This function does what it says on the tin.\n *\n * @param {DataView} memory\n * @param {number} start_word_count_inclusive\n * @param {number} end_word_count_inclusive\n * @param {number} words_per_row\n * @param {number} total_rows\n * @param {number} pixel_size\n **/": 1,

    "/*\nThis component was created by Claude 3.5 Here is the full chat, with minimal changes so that this comment doesn't cause errors: \n\nYou are a junior developer, and I am your senior developer. I need to implement a React message component for a message board application.\n\nKey requirements:\n\n\tThe component should accept a user's name, a message ID, the message itself, and a predefined image file as props.\n\tIt should sanitize the user\u2019s input before rendering.\n\tIt should display the user's name as a header and the message as the body.\n\tIt should display the image on the left side of the component, similar to 4chan. \n\tWhen clicked, it should use React Router to navigate to the URL /message/[id].\n\nPlease consider:\n\n\tProper input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.\n\tHandling edge cases such as empty messages or missing props.\n\tOptimizing performance by using React best practices.\n\tFollowing best practices for React and React Router.\n\tOverall clean and neat design.\nPlease do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.\nGenerate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.\n\nResponse:\nI'll help you create a new Message component that we can use in the App.js file. First, let's create the Message component, and then I'll show you how to modify the App.js to use it.\nFirst, create a new file Message.js in the components directory:\n\nimport { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst Message = ({ id, user, text, image }) => {\n  const navigate = useNavigate();\n\n  // Handle click event to navigate to message detail\n  const handleMessageClick = () => {\n    navigate(`/message/${id}`);\n  };\n\n  // If any required props are missing, render nothing\n  if (!id || !text) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div \n      className=\"message-container\" \n      onClick={handleMessageClick}\n      role=\"button\"\n      tabIndex={0}\n      onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleMessageClick()}\n    >\n      <div className=\"message-image\">\n        <img \n          src={`/images/${image}`} \n          alt={`${user}'s avatar`}\n          onError={(e) => {\n            e.target.src = '/images/default-avatar.png';\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"message-content\">\n        <h2 className=\"message-user\">\n          {DOMPurify.sanitize(user || 'Anonymous')}\n        </h2>\n        <p className=\"message-text\">\n          {DOMPurify.sanitize(text)}\n          {DOMPurify.sanitize(text)}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n// PropTypes for type checking\nMessage.propTypes = {\n  id: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]).isRequired,\n  user: PropTypes.string,\n  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n  image: PropTypes.string,\n};\n\n// Default props\nMessage.defaultProps = {\n  user: 'Anonymous',\n  image: 'default-avatar.png',\n};\n\nexport default Message;\n\n\nNow, let's update your App.js to use the new Message component:\n\n// ... existing code ...\n\n\n        </div>\n        <h1>Message Board</h1>\n        {messages.map(message => (\n          <Message\n            key={message.id}\n            id={message.id}\n            user={message.user}\n            text={message.text}\n            image={message.image}\n          />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n  \n  // ... existing code ...\n\nAnd here's the CSS for the Message component (create a new file):\n\n.message-container {\n  display: flex;\n  padding: 1rem;\n  margin: 1rem 0;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  transition: background-color 0.2s;\n}\n\n.message-container:hover {\n  background-color: #f5f5f5;\n}\n\n.message-image {\n  flex: 0 0 100px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.message-image img {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n\n.message-content {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n.message-user {\n  margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;\n  font-size: 1.1rem;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.message-text {\n  margin: 0;\n  line-height: 1.4;\n}\n\nTo implement this, you'll need to:\n1. Install required dependencies:\n\nnpm install dompurify prop-types react-router-dom\n\n2. Update your app to use React Router (in index.js or App.js, depending on your setup).\nKey features of this implementation:\n1. Security: Uses DOMPurify to sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks\nAccessibility: Includes keyboard navigation support\nError Handling:\nHandles missing props with PropTypes and defaultProps\nIncludes fallback for failed image loads\nPerformance:\nUses proper key props for list rendering\nImplements proper event handling\nMaintainability:\nClear component structure\nWell-documented code\nType checking with PropTypes\nRemember to wrap your app with BrowserRouter from react-router-dom to enable routing functionality.\n\n\nPrompt:\nYou had an oversight. useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component. Please address this error, then get back to me.\n\nResponse:\nAh yes, we need to wrap the entire application with BrowserRouter from react-router-dom. Let's modify the main entry point of the application.\n\n// ... existing code ...\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <App />\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  </React.StrictMode>\n);\n// ... existing code ...\n\nThis modification wraps the entire App component with BrowserRouter, which provides the routing context necessary for useNavigate() to work properly. The error should now be resolved.\nMake sure you have react-router-dom installed in your project. If not, you can install it with:\n\nnpm install react-router-dom\n\n\nPrompt:\nYou did all the work correctly, but you forgot to import the styling you made! You're better than that, man.\n\n\nResponse:\nAh, you're absolutely right! Let's add the CSS import to the Message component.\n\n// ... existing code ...\nimport { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\nimport './Message.css';  // Add this import!\n\nconst Message = ({ id, user, text, image }) => {\n// ... existing code ...\n\nGood catch! The styling will now be properly applied to the Message component. Always remember to import your CSS files!\n*/": 1,
